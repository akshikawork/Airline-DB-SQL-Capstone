✈️ Airline Database Analytics Dashboard
Airline Performance & Passenger Experience Dashboard
Unlocking Insights into Airline Operations, Passenger Trends, and On-Time Performance

Purpose:
The Airline database is designed to simulate real-world aviation data, including flights, passengers, bookings, crew assignments, and delays. This project builds a robust analytical dashboard to monitor flight operations, passenger satisfaction, revenue performance, and delay patterns.

Tech Stack:
Database: Airline Sample DB (commonly used for academic and analytics projects)
Data Processing: SQL (Joins, CTEs, window functions, ranking)
ETL: SQL transformations

Data Source:
Airline Sample DB (tables like Flights, Passengers, Bookings, Airports, Aircrafts, Delays, Crew)

Highlights:

Business Problem:
Airlines face challenges in managing:
Flight delays & cancellations → customer dissatisfaction
Route profitability → optimizing underperforming routes
Passenger loyalty & repeat booking trends
Crew scheduling efficiency

Goal of the Project:
To deliver operational transparency and performance metrics that help airlines improve on-time performance, revenue, and passenger experience.

Walkthrough of the Project:
Flight Operations: Total flights, % delays, cancellation rates by route and aircraft type.
Passenger Analytics: Passenger demographics, frequent flyers, route-wise load factor.
Revenue Insights: Ticket sales by class (economy, business, first), top profitable routes.
Delay Analysis: Average delay minutes, causes of delays (weather, technical, crew issues).
Crew & Aircraft Utilization: Crew scheduling conflicts, aircraft turnaround time efficiency.

Key Insights:
Peak delays occur in evening flights on international routes → rescheduling recommended.
Business class tickets contribute ~40% of revenue though passengers are <15%.

Flights from certain hub airports show repeated delays due to weather → need predictive planning.

Aircraft utilization >85% leads to maintenance issues → balance between efficiency and reliability is required.
